# Smoking and Drinking Dataset ML Project

This project analyzes the Smoking and Drinking Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sooyoungher/smoking-drinking-dataset) to predict health and lifestyle-related patterns using machine learning models.  
The project implements multiple classifiers and demonstrates the impact of preprocessing and feature scaling on model performance.

## Team Contribution
This project was developed collaboratively by our team. My primary contributions include:
- Data processing: Cleaning, encoding, and handling missing values in the dataset  
- Feature scaling: Used MinMax Scaling.
- KNN implementation: Designing, training, and evaluating the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier  
- Model evaluation support: Assisting in performance measurement and result analysis
